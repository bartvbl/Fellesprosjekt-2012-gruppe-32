You CAN NOT simply copy the updated .java file from netBeans into here if you changed anything in the GUI designer.
I have for some of the files made changes that belong in that file.
To update the file, copy everything after netBean's generated comment warning you about automatic code generation, 
all the way to the bottom of the file. Then paste it in the corresponding location in the source file in eclipse.
You'll get warnings about that CalendarApp is missing. To fix it, replace "calendarApp.CalendarApp" by "fp.views.CalendarApp".
The .form and .resources files are fine (don't forget to update them too; they regenerate when you make changes in netBeans).
